## Project language: English

- **Code**: Variable names, function names, types, file names — all in English.
- **Comments**: Write every comment in English (intent, decisions, edge cases).
- **Docs/README**: Use English for documentation and in-code docs.
- **Commits**: Prefer English for commit messages.

## Workflow

- Work **iteratively**: small, verifiable steps; run tests/linters when relevant.
- Prefer **local, safe** refactors over large, risky changes.
- When adding new patterns or conventions, **update this .cursorrules** so the project stays consistent.

## Design principles

- **Single responsibility**: One module/class/function = one reason to change. Split when it does more than one clear job.
- **DRY**: Don't repeat yourself. Extract shared logic into a single place; duplicate only when requirements genuinely differ.
- **KISS**: Prefer the simplest solution that works. Avoid unnecessary abstraction and indirection.
- **Separation of concerns**: Keep UI, business logic, and data access in distinct layers; don't mix them in the same file/function.
- **Depend on abstractions**: Prefer interfaces/contracts over concrete types where it reduces coupling and eases testing.
- **Compose over inherit**: Favor composition and small, focused units over deep inheritance hierarchies.
- **Explicit over implicit**: Make data flow and dependencies obvious (parameters, return types, clear names) rather than hidden globals or magic.

## Code style

- Prefer clear code over long comments; comments explain **why** and **trade-offs**, not line-by-line **what**.
- On ambiguity, choose the safer, standard option and note assumptions briefly.
